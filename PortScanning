Port scanning finds out which services are offered by a host and help identify vulnerabilities on that host
You can identify a vulnerable port and launch an exploit
It is recommended that testers scan all ports during penetration test

Example Tools : Nmap, Nessus, Hping3, Zenmap

netdiscover -r <CIDR>

Port scanning programs like Nmap report open ports, closed ports, filtered ports and potential OS that is currently running

TCP Port Scan             SYN Port Scan
-------------             -------------
A -> B, SYN               A -> B, SYN
B -> A, SYN-ACK           B -> A, SYN-ACK
A -> B, ACK               A -> B, RST

NULL Scan
---------
All packet flags are turned off
Port is closed if port returns RST
Port is open if no response

XMAS Scan
---------
FIN, PSH and URG flags are set
Port is closed if port returns RST
