Internet runs on TCP/IP. There were bunch of protocols before that such as Apple, IPX etc
Protocol : Common language used by computers to speak and understand each other

Application Layer
-----------------
It includes network services like HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SSH, Telnet, SMTP
PDU : Data

Transport Layer
---------------
It is responsible for getting data packets to and from the app layer using port numbers. TCP is also responsible for packet delivery verification by using acknowledgments. 
Two common protocol : TCP and UDP
PDU : Segment
Encapsulate data into segments
TCP
---
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. There is a three way handshake process.
A -> B, SYN
B -> A, SYN-ACK
A -> B, ACK
TCP is slow and high-effort protocol. It ensures packet delivery, meaning it performs reliable segment transfer
It has flow control and congestion control mechanism
Tear-down operation by using FIN flag
TCP Header Fields : Source Port, Destination Port, Sequence Number, Acknowledgment Number, Data Offset, Reserved, Flags, Windows
Checksum, Urgent Pointer, Options, Padding and Data
TCP Flags : SYN, ACK, PSH, URG, RST, FIN

Initial Sequence Number (ISN) : ISN, enabling reassembly of large packets, tracks packets received. 32 bit number. It is sent on steps 1 and 2 during three-way
handshake process. By guessing ISN values, a hacker can hijack a TCP session, which can lead to gain access to a server without logging in 

UDP
---
Faster than UDP.
No 3WHSK
Unreliable protocol
Send and pray
Does not verify the fact that the receiver is listening
Connectionless protocol



Network Layer : It uses IP addresses to route packets to their appropriate destination network. (Delivering packets among different networks)
