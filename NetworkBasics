Internet runs on TCP/IP. There were bunch of protocols before that such as Apple, IPX etc
Protocol : Common language used by computers to speak and understand each other

Application Layer
-----------------
It includes network services like HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SSH, Telnet, SMTP
PDU : Data

Transport Layer
---------------
It is responsible for getting data packets to and from the app layer using port numbers. TCP is also responsible for packet delivery verification by using acknowledgments. 
Two common protocol : TCP and UDP
PDU : Segment
Encapsulate data into segments
TCP
---
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. There is a three way handshake process.
A -> B, SYN
B -> A, SYN-ACK
A -> B, ACK
TCP is slow and high-effort protocol. It ensures packet delivery, meaning it performs reliable segment transfer
It has flow control and congestion control mechanism
Tear-down operation by using FIN flag

UDP
---
Faster than UDP.
No 3WHSK
No realiable transfer mechanism
Send and pray



Network Layer : It uses IP addresses to route packets to their appropriate destination network. (Delivering packets among different networks)
