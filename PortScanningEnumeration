Port scanning finds out which services are offered by a host and help identify vulnerabilities on that host
You can identify a vulnerable port and launch an exploit
It is recommended that testers scan all ports during penetration test

Example Tools : Nmap, Nessus, Hping3, Zenmap

netdiscover -r <CIDR>

Port scanning programs like Nmap report open ports, closed ports, filtered ports and potential OS that is currently running

TCP Port Scan             SYN Port Scan
-------------             -------------
A -> B, SYN               A -> B, SYN
B -> A, SYN-ACK           B -> A, SYN-ACK
A -> B, ACK               A -> B, RST

NULL Scan
---------
All packet flags are turned off
Port is closed if port returns RST
Port is open if no response

XMAS Scan
---------
FIN, PSH and URG flags are set
Port is closed if port returns RST
Port is open if no response

FIN Scan
--------
Only FIN flag is set
Port is closed if port returns RST
Port is open if no response

***NULL, XMAS, and FIN scans do not work on Windows machines

UDP Scan
--------
Closed ports respond with ICMP Port Unreachable

ACK Scan
--------
It is used to get info about Firewall
Statefull firewalls track connection and block unsolicited ACK packets

Ping Sweep
----------
Identify which IP addresses are alive by pinging a range of IP addresses
Shortcomings : Computers that are shut down cannot respond to ping. Some hosts are configured not to reply ping. Firewalls may filter out ICMP traffic

Enumeration
-----------
Enumeration process extracts information about resources or shares on the network, network topology and architecture, usernames or groups and so on

NBTScan
-------
NBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP) is the Windows networking protocol that is used for shared folders and printers
nbtscan is a tool which enumerates Windows operating system
usage : nbtscan <CIDR>
