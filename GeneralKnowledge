Cyber Security Tests
--------------------
Security Audits : Checklist of best practices
Vulnerability Assessment : Identifying security holes
Penetration Test : Exploiting vulnerabilities

Vulnerability Assessment
------------------------
It is the process of identifying security holes in IT systems and applications
During vulnerability assessment, you don't go beyond identifying vulnerabilities
No exploitation, no post exploitation
You don't know whether the finding is true positive or false positive
You don't try to exploit the potential vulnerability during Vulnerability Assessment process

Vulnerability Assessment Steps
------------------------------
Identify assets and build IT inventory
Categorize assets into groups
Scan assets against known vulnerabilities
Rank risks (CVSS)
Patch management
Rescan

Terminology
-----------
Threat is anything that can exploit a vulnerability. We try to protect our assets against threats
Vulnerability can be defined as weaknesses and security holes in an IT asset that can be exploited by threats
Exploit can be defined as a piece of software or q sequence of commands that takes advantage of a vulnerability to cause unintended behavior to occur
An exploit is an attack on an IT asset that takes advantage of a vulnerability that the IT asset has
Exploit also refers to the act of successfully making such an attack


Malware
-------
It includes virus, worms, trojan horses. Malware's objective is to destroy data, showdown a network or system.

Viruses
-------
Attach itself into an executable
Need user interaction
Need a host program to replicate itself

AntiVirus Software
------------------
Try to detect and remove virus
Work based on signature-based detection. Recently, anomaly-based
AV database needs to be updated periodically

Trojan Horses
-------------
Disguise themselves as useful programs
Hide malicious content inside a program such as backdoor, rootkit

Spyware
-------
Exfiltrate information from victim computer to the attacker. This info includes but not limited to financial data, password, PIN etc
It can be form of keylogger

Adware
------
Similar to spyware in that it can be installed without the user being aware
Main objective is to determine user's onlien habits so that users will be displayed tailored advertisement
It slows down the computer

Ping of Death Attack
--------------------
It is a type of DoS attack that attacker creates an ICMP packet larger than 65535 bytes
Large ICMP packet is fragmented at source and destination tries to reassemble it
Destination does not know how to deal with that large ICMP packet. As a result, destination system crashes
Modern OSs are protected 

Session Hijacking
-----------------
Enables attacker to interrupt a TCP session
Taking over another user's session
It is about guessing TCP sequence number
Mitigation : Random initial sequence number

DNS Zone Transfer
-----------------
DNS resolves hostnames to IP addresses
DNS Zone Transfer Tools : Dig, Host, Fierce
DNS Zone Transfer enables attacker to see all hosts on a network
It gives you the organization's network topology
